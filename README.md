*A Peggle-inspired game built with Python and Pygame*

Kanda is a peggle-inspired game where you use the mouse to aim and shoot a cannon at various pegs. 
Hitting all of the orange pegs clears a stage but you only get a limited amount of balls to shoot.
There are three stages and for each of those stages you can pick between easy, medium and hard.
The harder the difficulty the less balls are given in a stage.
You can create a user to automatically save any scores to a local leader board.
Gaining score in a stage is done in multiple ways:
  Hitting pegs (blue pegs give the least, purple the most).
  Retaining balls at the end of a stage.
  At the end of the stage there is a multiplier given based on the difficulty you chose.
