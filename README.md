*A Peggle-inspired game built with Python and Pygame*

A short arcade-style puzzle game built as part of my sixth-form coursework in 2023, featuring multiple levels, user profiles, and a local leaderboard.

Kanda is a peggle-inspired game where you use the mouse to aim and shoot a cannon at various pegs.
Hitting all of the orange pegs clears a stage but the challenge comes when you only have a limited amount of balls to shoot.
